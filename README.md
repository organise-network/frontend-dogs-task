# Dogs App

This repository contains the initial code for a React app about dogs. To complete the app, you'll need to add the functionality for browsing random (& very cute) dog photos, saving your favourites, and sharing links to pictures.

You will need to get images of dogs from the API at [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).

## Take-home task

**You should spend a MAXIMUM of 90 minutes on this exercise**, and it doesn't matter if you finish every single task. Please don't feel pressure to over-invest your personal time. We are evaluating how you approach the exercise, not whether you complete every single task/requirement.

There is no expectation to add tests or styling into your project. **We will not be evaluating you on these.**

*We're more than happy to help you with any questions you have about the exercise -- please let us know if you'd like support by emailing andrew@organise.network & martina@organise.network -- asking questions is not part of our evaluation.*

## Set up before you start

1. Ensure you have **node** (min. version `14.18.1`) & **npm** (min. version `6.4.15`) installed in your local dev environment. *We're more than happy to help you with this -- please let us know if you'd like support! This set up is not part of our evaluation.*
2. Install your **IDE/code editor of choice** (we use VSCode & Webstorm, and we're more than happy for you to use your personal favourite).
3. Have a **Github account** ready to go for this project, or create a new one. 
4. **Clone this repo** into your own! Please make your GitHub clone a private repo.

## Commands

- `npm install`: Install dependencies
- `npm start`: Run the project

## What you need to do

- **Task 1:** When the "Next Dog" button is clicked, show a new random picture of a dog in the "Random Dogs" panel.
- **Task 2:** When the "Save Image" button is clicked, this image should be added to the "Saved Photos" area.
- **Task 3:** Add a "Delete Image" button to the Saved Photos, so users can delete images they've previously saved.
- **Task 4:** Add a "Share this Image" button, so a user can share a link to the Dog App, which will show the shared image.
- **Task 5:** Add a "Previous Dog" button, which lets a user go back to the last random dog image they viewed.

## What we're evaluating

1. How you approach adding new features to a new codebase
2. How you work with backend APIs
3. How you prioritise tasks
4. How you deal with any ambiguity in requirements

## Submission of your exercise

1. Before submitting, please add a section to the top of this README with some _brief_ documentation explaining how far through the tasks you got, your approach, any assumptions you have made, and any improvements you would make given more time.
2. To submit your task, please commit & push your changes to your private GitHub repo. 
3. Give access to the following GitHub users so we can review your submission:
  - https://github.com/asibs
  - https://github.com/martinaschwarz

4. Finally, please email andrew@organise.network & martina@organise.network to let us know you have completed the exercise, with a link to your private GitHub repo.
